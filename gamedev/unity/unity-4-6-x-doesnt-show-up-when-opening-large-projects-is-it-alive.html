Also CPU activity keeps at low rate.  On Mac OS X it is possible to track Unity’s background activity when it is reading files using following command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo fs_usage | grep Unity | grep /</code></p>

<p>This command shows which files are being opened by Unity at the time. This should give you enough information on its current activity and make a rough estimation of process complete time.</p>
